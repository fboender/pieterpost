This file lists changes which might break upgrading or should be taken 
notice of when installing pieterpost. 

v0.10.1
	In this release the default preferences dir has changed, so you should 
	either change it during setup to the old dir (/usr/local/pieterpost/) or
	copy the old files from /usr/local/pieterpost (or whatever you specified
	during setup last time) to the new /var/pieterpost. This is only needed
	if you are updating a previous version of pieterpost.

	PP now uses ':' to seperate usernames and groups in chmod operations. In
	old versions of chmod, this used to be '.', so if you get errors, you
	should do it by hand, or change the ':'s to '.'s in the setup file.

v0.10
	This release features mayor code cleanups, and might cause some loss
	of preferences.
