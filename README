1. What is PieterPost?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  PieterPost is a pop3/mail web interface written in PHP(4). It allows
  you to access your mail through any normal browser provided it 
  supports cookies.
  
  It's kind of feature-less as of yet because the POP3 protocol is only
  limited, but I hope to work around that in the future.
  
  But it's primary function (at this time) is just viewing mail, and 
  being able to reply to it. 
  
  PieterPost is probably not conform to any RFC out there, but I
  really don't give a rat's ass. It works for me. But if you have any
  suggestions, feel free to mail them to me.
  
  
  The newest version of PieterPost can be found here:

3. Requirements.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  PieterPost requires :
  
    * A http server
    * PHP4, with imap.so module (or build in support).
    * A pop3 daemon.
  
  PieterPost uses CSS2, and therefor does not work well with Netscape 4.x,
  Opera 5.0 and Internet Explorer 4.x. (themes will look bad) Links (text 
  browser) also does not seem to work due to some cookie problem. Supported 
  browsers are:
  
    * Mozilla 
    * Netscape 6.x+
    * IE 5.x (and higher) (See Installation section about SSL)
    * Opera 6.0+
    * Lynx
  
  Support for older browserversions is now supported through a non-css2 theme.
  It's very basic, but seems to work. The theme is named 'notheme'.

4. Installation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Run './setup.sh' to setup and install PieterPost on your system.
  
  You need to check your php configuration for the following:
  
    * imap.so module or build in imap support.
      (Pieterpost will display an error when it's not found)
    * Session support.
      (PieterPost will display an error when it's not there)
    * Preference directory access.
      If the php configuration specifies the open_basedir directive, php might
      not allow access to the preference directory. In this case you'll need to
      either modify the php configuration, or place the preference directory in
      a place which is reachable for your script.
  
  If your PHP configuration does not have the imap.so module available, you
  should install it. For this you may consult your PHP manual or installation
  guide. Some tips:
  
    - Debian users 
      apt-get install php4-imap
      
    - Compiling from source:
      Compile with: --with-imap
  
  If you want undeliverable mail errors to return to the user who sent them, 
  you must make sure that your smtp-server allows the webserver user to set 
  the From: field. For Exim, this means you'll have to add the webserver user 
  (On Debian systems www-data) to the trusted_users option in the 
  configuration file:
  
    /etc/exim.conf:
    
    trusted_users = mail:www-data
  
  For Sendmail, it means you either have to start using Exim, or figure it 
  out yourself. (I'll bet I'm gonna get some comments on this ;-)
  
  
  Sometimes downloading attachments over SSL in IE might not work. This is 
  caused by a bug in the extra headers sent when using SSL. It can be fixed
  by adding this line to you apache-ssl configuration:
  
  BrowserMatch ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
  
  For Debian, this line should be added to the srm.conf file.

  This fix will not always work. Some users report that it fixed the problem,
  for some users it didn't work at all. There is nothing I can do about it,
  it's a bug in Internet Explorer. Try upgrading to the latest version of
  IE, and hope that Microsoft finally got some sence and adhered to the 
  standards instead of doing everything their own way.


  To allow large attachments to be sent, you must change the 
  upload_max_filesize directive in the php.ini configuration file.


  4.1 Themes.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    Version 0.8.6+ has support for themes. The theme files are suffixed with a
    .pt extention, and reside in the themes/ directory under the preferences
    dir. During setup, you will be asked which theme you want to use. Bluegreen
    is the default.
    
    If you ever want to change the default theme, you can either re-run setup, 
    or you can edit your pp.php by hand and modify the $theme variable at the 
    top somewhere. 

    Each user can change his own theme by choosing one in the preferences
    screen.
    
    Creating your own theme should be fairly easy. Just copy a .pt file to a
    new name, make sure your PieterPost uses the new theme file (see the 
    paragraph above for instructions) and start modifying the stylesheet. If
    your theme is complete, please mail it to me, so I can include it in the
    next version of PieterPost.
    
    Sometimes PHP will be set up in a manner that will not allow including or 
    reading files from different dirs than the www dir, or some other 
    directories set in the php.ini configuration file.This will pose a problem
    for themes/languages, because they can't be included/read from the script
    dir. A (bad) fix for this is to disable safemode, or allow PHP to read 
    from the /usr/local/pieterpost (or whatever you entered during setup for 
    the preferences path) path.
  
  4.2 Language support.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As of Pieterpost 0.9, it now contains beta language support. I suppose it
    still needs some work, but that's something to take care of in 1.0 beta's.

    In the directory languages/ in the PP source package, you'll find files
    with a .lang extention. These files simply contain a list of strings 
    sed in the interface.

    To create a new language, take the english.lang (or any other if you 
    please) and translate the strings. I'd appreciate it if you'd sent the 
    new translation to me. Also mention if you are willing to maintain the 
    language file. This will be necassary whenever the format for the 
    language file changes (as it did in the v0.10 release), or whenever new
    items are added which need translation. 

    Pay special attention to some of the strings which contain non-alpha 
    characters like quotes and stuff. They must be escaped. Sometimes using
    \\n, sometimes \n, sometimes \', sometimes \\'. Escaping gets particulary
    weird when the message will be displayed through javascript, because JS
    wants stuff to be escaped too. It would be easier to simply copy the stuff
    in the english language file. It shows how to escape things proparly.


5. Project goals.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Project goals for PieterPost are to create a small and easy to use 
  web front-end to pop3 email boxes. Preferably all in one file. (except for
  the settings) Pieterpost is designed to be used to quickly view your email 
  when you're not at home. Pieterpost will include all frequently and handy
  features of any mail client, but will not include any less used funtionallity.
  (unless I think it's neat-o :)
  
  As of yet, there are no plans to make Pieterpost a full-blown email client,
  though project goals may change at any time.
  
  
6. For administrators.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This section is intended for system administrators who would like to 
  offer Pieterpost to the users on their systems. It goes more in-depth on
  how internals of Pieterpost works, so they can see if it meets their 
  desires. This section might also be usefull for developers. Might. 
  
  Pieterpost calls pop3 directly. Both for retrieval of messages and 
  authentification. (use SSL ;) It does this every time. Messages are not
  stored on the filesystem by Pieterpost. All emails remain on the pop3
  server, unless the user deletes them, or retrieves them using a different
  client which does remove them and store them locally.
  
  All settings (both global and user-specific) are stored in a preferences
  directory which can be given when setting up Pieterpost. Default is (I 
  think) : /usr/local/pieterpost
  
  For each user some files are kept with their settings. These are
  [username].address  : Addressbook 
  [username].msg      : Seen message-id's.
  [username].prefs    : Preferences
  
  Users' files which do not exist on the system anymore may be deleted. I 
  should write a script to automatically do this. Better add that to the 
  TODO list.
  
  The preferences also includes a directory for the themes/. Here you can 
  add/modify/delete themes. PieterPost users can't choose their own theme,
  so the theme you chose during setup is system wide.
  
  When Pieterpost contacts the pop3 server, it retrieves some basic
  information about the mails. It checks the .msg file to see if the 
  specific email has already been read.
  
  Pieterpost installs only one file in the webserver dir, namelly pp.php.

7. Security.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Pieterpost in its unstable condition (all version < 1.0) is considered 
  insecure and an incarnation of the devil himself in the form of a php
  script. Well, maybe not _that_ insecure, but anyway. Pieterpost tries 
  to be as secure as possible, but security bugs are most probably still 
  present in it. 

  Authorization is done through the POP3 daemon, which should prove pretty
  secure. But since it is very easy to sniff out passwords on networks,
  you should always use Pieterpost over secure SSL connections only!

  Pieterpost has been tested with the register_globals directive off and 
  the safe_mode directive on, so you can use these to harden security for 
  php scripts on your servers.

  You should also note that the session data files which are stored by
  PHP on your filesystem contain the username and password for a user, 
  and if your php configuration is not secure enough, it can be read by
  users allowed to create php files. This is just a configuration setup 
  theory, but you could set the session save handler to memory or modify
  the session save path to point to somewhere normal system users can't 
  read them and make sure they can't be read using PHP too. (base dir 
  restrictions and all that)
  
  Anyway, the most important points are:
  * Run it over SSL ONLY!
  * Do not run your webserver as user nobody!
  
  Also read the beautiful NO WARRANTY disclaimer in the GPL. ;)
